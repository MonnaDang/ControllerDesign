In this presentation, we have explored various techniques for selecting parameters for a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller, including the 
renowned Ziegler-Nichols tuning method. 

By conducting a comprehensive system analysis, I have illustrated an approach that simplifies the process of parameter selection for the PI 
controller.

My goal is to empower myself and you with the knowledge and insights needed to confidently determine the optimal parameters for your PI 
controller. While I have endeavored to provide accurate and valuable information, it's important to acknowledge that there may be certain 
aspects that could benefit from further refinement or clarification, owing to the limitations of my knowledge.

If you have any questions, concerns, or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to assist and address any 
inquiries to the best of my knowledge and abilities.
